An example of the former is how all high school males in anime seemed to be voiced by a guy who sounds like he's in his 30s/40s whereas Japanese VAs, despite their age, can produce higher pitched voices that sound like school kids. Yuki Kaji is a good example of a VA that does this.\n\n3) English dubs are always done in an American accent and so just don't fit the setting most of the time. An example of the latter is Zen from Akagami no Shirayuki-hime.

In fact, there are many parts of it that I\u2019m quite fond of. I think the colossal effort the staff put in with their backs against the wall like that sublimated the episode\u2019s cheapness into solid humor.\n\n> That scene when our heroines\u2019 daily lives with their switched personalities are stung together with snapshots\u2026 I\u2019ve thought for a long time that the audio mix was kind of thin there, but in this 5.1 remaster, it\u2019s finally got nice, lively sound.\n\n> Which reminds me: What had me worried during production was this episode\u2019s \u201cclimax\u201d.\n\n> \u201cWhich scene is the climactic one?!\u201d, I agonized.\n\n> Looking back on it now, maybe it was the part when Nanami slipped on the banana peel?", "date": "2017-01-23"}, {"text": "Well that was another fillerlike episode.

Unfortunately, her lackeys have gotten spice that\u2019s far too spicy and there\u2019s an explosion.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a funny reason for the Student Council to assemble. They\u2019re worried that Utena and Anthy are injured in an event unforeseen by End of the World\u2019s letters. But, Utena and Anthy are proclaimed okay.\n\nAs it turns out, Utena and Anthy have had their personalities switched with each other by the curry. I started to get something was wrong after Utena collapsed when Wakaba jumped on her back. But I only realized they had switched when Anthy slapped back the girls bullying her.\n\nIt is really odd to see Utena and Anthy acting like each other because they are so different from each other.\n\nBased on the fact that Utena and Nanami are acting like each other (which is already funny to see), Nanami and her lackeys realize that they\u2019ve switched personalities.\n\nIt is funny to see the girls selling the photos they took as proof. It\u2019s even funnier to see Miki lament the change in Anthy\u2019s personality, before immediately buying a bunch of photos. And the funniest was Touga walking in to chastise Nanami, before buying an even larger amount of photos.\n\nBecause of this, Utena and Anthy figure out that they\u2019re personalities have been switched. And Nanami admits she did it, rather than have Touga take the blame. So she and her lackeys go to India to get the curry spice again.\n\nThe running gag of Nanami\u2019s adventures in India was hilarious every time they cut to it. The elephants constantly ruining everything just got funnier and more absurd as it went along. The funniest one was the surfing elephants, just because it was so bizarre.\n\nWhat was also funny was Utena, as Anthy, getting stuck in the exchange diary that Saionji has been keeping between him and Anthy.\n\nWow, Anthy is still as submissive as ever. She just throws out the diary when Utena says she doesn\u2019t want to look in it and violate Anthy\u2019s privacy, even though that\u2019s not at all what Utena ment. \n\nUtena, after reading the unflattering insults Saionji made about her in the diary, is also funny as she decides to write the meanest possible thing to Saionji, before giving it to him with a smile.\n\nNanami finally arrives back from India with the secret spie, before \u2018divine justice\u2019 strikes and the spice is destroyed and scattered, meaning Utena and Anthy may be stuck like this.\n\nThe twist at the end is that the secret spice was never even used. Anthy\u2019s cooking is just that terrible that she managed to switch their personalities just by cooking normally. Admittedly, that is a really funny twist.\n\nAnd of course Saionji stops by to complain now that he realizes Utena and Anthy have switched personalities, only for him to eat the curry at the same time as Chu-Chu does, causing another curry explosion that switches back Utena and Anthy.\n\nThe last bit in this episode made me lose it with laughter. Chu-Chu practicing kendo, with Saionji\u2019s hairstyle and Saionji eating a banana in the treetops in a jungle. Those were hilarious.\n\nSide notes: I like how the shadow play came up a second time as the \u2018divine justice\u2019 it talked about struck Nanami.", "date": "2017-01-23"}, {"text": "This episode was \n\n#SO WEIRD\n\nThese Nanami episodes are crazy.

At least Nanami was happy to do it since her onii-sama wasn't angry with her.\n\nOne of the best things to see was Anthy slapping the [shit out of that girl]( http://imgur.com/udmTP9W). It marks the first time that a slap in the series was not done on Anthy.\n\nAnother funny thing was the entire debacle concerning Saionji's exchange diary. Saionji undressing himself to reveal the diary, \"Utena\" throwing it in the bin because it invaded her privacy and that quality drawing that Saionji drew. Of course Utena gets back at him by writing \"dumbass\".\n\nFinally, Chu-Chu and Saionji exchanged personalities because of the curry mishap.

Near sucks, but if we got to see a bit more of what really goes on in his head, show him having interactions with other characters beyond giving orders, maybe he could become somewhat likeable. As it is, he's a Mary Sue with some quirks that feel like they're there for the sake of it. We never get to see him showing genuine emotions or even outside of that little room besides one or two scenes. We're told that he has terrible social skills but we never actually see that, it never has any impact on anything so it's hardly a flaw. We get to see what L is like in all sorts of situations, we see him displaying every emotion from joy to surprise to sheer terror, and it makes him a way more likeable and relatable character.
