<h1>Ruths' Projects</h1>
<h4>mini practice projects</h4>

<p>
I did these projects before the summer of 2017 as exercises to prepare me to join Dr. Derek Ruths' Network Dymanics Lab.<br />
They focus on web requests, data scraping, probablilistic classification, and the use of python tools such as SciKit Learn.
